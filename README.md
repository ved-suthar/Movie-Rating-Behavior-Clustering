# Movie-Rating-Behavior-Clustering
This project analyzes user rating behavior using the MovieLens dataset.  The goal of this project is to group users based on how they rate movies using Unsupervised Machine Learning (KMeans Clustering).  I used around 20,000 movie rating records for this analysis.
